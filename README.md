# Welcome to the STEP Hardware Repository

We plan to focus on designing a wearable that helps people communicate with “smart” technology in an unobtrusive, private, and efficient manner. We want our system to support more natural interactions with smart technologies.

In this repository you'll find all of the hardware projects we've been working on.
